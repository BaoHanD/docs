On Katalon TestOps, if we are team owners or admins, we can change a failed Test Result of a Test Run to a passed Test Result. 

We choose **Reports & Analytics** > **Test Runs**. Then we click to select an ID of the Test Run that we want to execute.

The Summary of Test Run displays, click and choose **Mark as Passed** at the Test Result, which we want to change from failed status to passed status.

On the board **Change status** display, click **Yes** to accept.

The board **Test Results** displays, and we can see the test result with passed status.

We click test result, which we have changed from failed status to passed status, and the board **Test Result:** displays. We click on the **Comments** tab.

And now, we can see the comments about changing the status.

We can change a passed Test Results to failed Test Results with similar steps.
