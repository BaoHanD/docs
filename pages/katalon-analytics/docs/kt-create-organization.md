In Katalon TestOps, you can set up a new organization, create projects, and invite members to the organization.

> You need a Katalon account. Register [here](https://www.katalon.com/sign-up/) if you don't have one.

## Creating an organization

By creating an organization, team members can collaborate across several projects instantly.

You own a personal organization by default. You can create a new organization and belong to any other organization you are invited to.

To create a new organization, follow these steps:

1. Sign in [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login).

2. Click on the **TestOps** icon at the top left corner of the homepage.

   Click **Create Organization** in the popup bar.

3. Type a name for your new organization, then click **Create**.

You have just created a new organization in which you are the Owner.

### Setting up the first project

After creating a new organization, Katalon TestOps prompts you to set up a project and invite other members as follows:

1. Type in **Project name** and click **Create**.

   > Note:
   >
   > You should [create a team](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/setup-team.html#create-a-team) before setting up your project. Or else, Katalon TestOps automatically stores your project in the First Team.

2. Type email addresses of your team members in **Share projects to your members**. Click **Invite**.
