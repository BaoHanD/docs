## Prerequisites:
You have already integrated Katalon Studio (version 8.1 or later) with Katalon TestOps.

## View Re-run Test Results

If you execute a Test Run multiple times, you can view the Re-run Test Results in that Test Run's summary and details.

The final status of a Test Run is linked with its latest execution result.

Following these steps:

2. Go to **Reports & Analytics** and click **Test Runs**.
3. Select **Test Run** with multiples execution from Katalon Studio.

### View final results

To see the latest result of a test execution, click the **Test Results** tab.

A re-run result has the *Re-run #* label next to its name.
