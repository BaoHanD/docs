## Release

Represents a version or a milestone of a software product, which consists of one or more **Test Cases**.  

**Usage**

Manages your test cases and testing progress by milestone. With Katalon TestOps Release, you can view the overall performance and readiness of the software product to be deployed with confidence.

> Releases can be managed in **Test Planning** section.      

**Example**

## Build

Represents a version of a software product, which the development team hands over to the testing team for testing purposes. A build also consists of one or more **Test Cases**.  

**Usage**

This feature strengthens collaboration among developers and testers. Hence, you can manage product readiness efficiently and seamlessly. 

> **Build** list can be viewed and managed on **Releases** detailed page.      

**Example**

## Test Run

Consists of one or more test case, depending on whether it is conducted parallelly, to be scheduled or executed.

**Usage**

Gives you the related information of running Test Cases.  A Test Run will keep track of the test result, when the test was ran, Test Run status, duration, assignee, etc. 

> Test Runs can be planned in **Test Planning** section.
>
> After being executed, you can view their results in **Reports & Analytics** section.                                                                            

**Examples**

## Trigger

By when the Test Run should be executed. (A Trigger can be an Event (e.g. from Github or Jira), or a time interval).   

**Usage**

**Katalon TestOps** provides you an ability to determine when the Test Run is executed so that you can actively plan your testing procedure.
                 
**Example**

## Test Environment

In what machines the Test Run should be executed. If a Test Environment is a local machine, it has to be controlled by an Agent.           

**Usage**

Used to execute test cases along with Script Repository after being configured. **Katalon TestOps** allows you to create a Test Environment with the following options:
- Your local machine
- Kubernetes environment
- CircleCI environment

> Test Environments can be managed in **Configurations** section.

**Example**

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-terminology/test-environment.png)



## Script Repository

Stores the actual test automation scripts to be executed.                           

**Usage**

Gives you a space to manage all test scripts and decide which one to be executed along with the given Test Environment. In **Katalon TestOps**, Script Repository can be a Git repository or a ZIP file. 

> Script Repository can be managed in **Configurations** section.                    

**Example**

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-terminology/script-repository.png)                                           


## Test Run Type

A collection of Test Runs having the same configurations.  

**Usage**

Gives you an ability to view the list of Test Run with similar configurations (Test Environment, Trigger, Script Repository) so that you can better manage your Test Runs.

> You can find Test Run Types in **Test Planning** section.   

**Example**

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-terminology/test-run-type.png)   


## Test Session

Being created once a Test Run is executed. Each Test Run can be executed as one or many Test Sessions depending on whether it is conducted parellely. 

**Usage**

Gives you information after executing a subset of the overall Test Run. In **Katalon TestOps**, each Test Session contains:
- One or more Test Cases
- Test Environment and test scripts in Script Repository used for the execution of each Test Case 

**Example**

## Test Result

A result of a Test Case after being executed.                                                                                                                             
**Usage**

Gives you detailed results after a Test Case is executed from **Katalon Studio** (or other apps). Usually, Test Results are organized into one or more Test Suites and can link to one or more Defects to track bugs and failures.

> To view Test Result, in **Reports & Analytics**, go to Test Runs > select one Test Run to view details. Here you can view all details of the Test Case after being executed.  

**Example**

## Defect

Represents a Jira Issue linked to a (failed) Test Run in **Katalon TestOps**.                                                                                       

**Usage**

Gives you an oveview of performance of Test Runs by Jira issue so that you can have full control and awareness of any problem for better test maintenance.

> You can find Defects in **Test Management** section.
>
> Learn how to link Test Runs to Jira Defects [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/ka-defects.html).

**Example**

## Assertion

A statement that a predicate (Boolean-valued function, a trueâ€“false expression) is expected to always be true at that point in the code. Assertion is the validation step that determines whether the automated Test Case succeeded or not.

**Usage**

**Katalon TestOps** provides you a specific view of Assertions in each Test Case. This used to evaluate the quality of Test Case and ensure that your application is working correctly by checking whether a condition is true, i.e., whether labels, data, API responses, etc., are rendered correctly.

> Assertion statistics of each Test Case are displayed in the list of Test Cases from **Test Management**.
>
> To view details of Assertions, in **Reports & Analytics**, go to Test Runs > select a Test Run to view details. Here you can view the list of Assertions with status, errors and logs.

**Example**

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-terminology/assertion.png)                                                                                        
## Requirement

Represents a Jira Issue linked to a Test Case in **Katalon TestOps**.                

**Usage**
