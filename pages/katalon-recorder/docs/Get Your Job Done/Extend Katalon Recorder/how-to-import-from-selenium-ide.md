From version 5.5.0, you can import tests from Selenium IDE to preserve the existing body of work and benefit from using Katalon Recorder.

Follow these steps to import from Selenium IDE:
1. Click on Selenium IDE icon in the Test Explorer.
2. Choose a Selenium IDE project file that ends with `.side`.
3. If there are incompatible commands, review them to see if they break the relevant tests.

Take a look at this reference to see the list of Selenium IDE commands supported in KR.
