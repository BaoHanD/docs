* testops.katalon.io
* admin.katalon.com

<details><summary>License Quota exceeded</summary>

This exception means the number of licenses in use (both online and offline) exceeds the total number of licenses that your Organization has subscribed to. This may cause the [sessions terminated](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/session-termination.html). To ensure the business continuity, we recommend you to subscribe more licenses.

</details>

<details><summary>Your trial has expired. Please subscribe to continue using Katalon Runtime Engine.</summary>

Valid business email registration is eligible for a 30-day trial of both Katalon Studio Enterprise and Katalon Runtime Engine floating licenses. When your trial period expires, you need to subscribe to the paid license of each product to continue using it. Currently, the free license for Katalon Runtime Engine is not available.

If you have subscribed to a Katalon license but cannot use it, please check if you are granted the permission to use. Please see the instruction [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/use-online-license.html).

</details>

<details><summary>Trial license is only available for Katalon accounts registered with a business email.</summary>

If you encounter this exception, properly you have registered a Katalon account with a personal email (e.g. with public domain like `@gmail.com`). Katalon Studio Enterprise and Katalon Runtime Engine trial licenses can only be registered with **business** emails.
